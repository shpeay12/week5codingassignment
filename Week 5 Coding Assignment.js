//Week 5 Coding Assignment | Menu App | Hunter Peay | Promineo Tech FE May 2023

//Instructions:
//Create a menu app as seen in this weekâ€™s video. What you create is up to you as long as it meets the following requirements:
// Use at least one array.
// Use at least two classes.
// Your menu should have the options to create, view, and delete elements.

//Code Explanation: For my assignment, I will be creating a menu app that allows the user to create a political party and register to vote.
//The voter can create a party, register as a voter of that party, view their party, delete their party and display all parties

//MY CODE:

class Voter { //Created voter class that takes name, address, and state to register the voter.
    constructor(name, address, state){
        this.name = name;
        this.address = address;
        this.state = state;
    }

    describe(){
        return `Voter Name: ${this.name}, Voter Address: ${this.address}, State: ${this.state}`
    }
}

class Party { //Party class takes in a preference and has a voter array.
    constructor(preference){
        this.preference = preference;
        this.voter = [];
    }
    addVoter(voter){
        if (voter instanceof Voter){
            this.voter.push(voter); //Pushes a new voter to the array
        } else {
            throw new Voter(`Invalid Voter Information. Please Re-enter Information`)
        }
    }
    describe(){
        return `${this.preference} has ${this.voter.length} voters.`
    }
}

class Menu { //creates a menu class
    constructor() {
        this.party = []; //Array of parties.
        this.selectedParty = null;
    }

    start() { //Creates a method
        let voterSelection = this.showVoterOptions();
        while (voterSelection != 0) { //Creates a switch that takes in multiple cases. This allows the voter to select the menu options.
            switch (voterSelection) {
                case '1': 
                    this.registerParty(); //Create a political party
                    break;
                case '2':
                    this.viewParty(); //View a political party and the registered voters.
                    break;
                case '3':
                    this.deleteParty(); //Deletes a political party.
                    break;
                case '4':
                    this.displayParties(); //Displays all parties.
                    break;
                default:
                    selection = 0; //Exits the menu.
            }
            voterSelection = this.showVoterOptions();
        }
        alert ('Goodbye!');
    }
